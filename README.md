Archived content relating to the update to the CLA Assistant open project gist file on July 13 2021.

# Background

On July 13 2021, I updated the GH gist file for the Open Project i-CLAs to remove outdated text about the need to receive and respond to a confirming email that came from the original Drupal i-CLA implementation. 

Before making the edits I downloaded the CLAs from each OP. After making the edit, discovered that the link from the CLA to the data file was lost and CLA Assistant showed 0 signatures. I imported the data back into the data files. However, they all showed the date of signature as July 13. 

Therefore, I am storing the extracted copies of the signatures with the original signing dates to this repository. 

1) oslc-op-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for OSLC Open Project. 8 signatures

2) originbx-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for OriginBX Open Project. 2 signatures

3) oca-op-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for Open Cybersecurity Alliance Open Project. 76 signatures

4) eea-oasis-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for EEA Community Projects Managed Open Project. 3 signatures
