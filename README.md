# Background

On July 13 2021, I updated the GH gist file for the Open Project i-CLAs to remove outdated text about the need to receive and respond to a confirming email that came from the original Drupal i-CLA implementation. 

Before making the edits I downloaded the CLAs from each OP. After making the edit, discovered that the link from the CLA to the data file was lost and CLA Assistant showed 0 signatures. I imported the data back into the data files. However, they all showed the date of signature as July 13. 

Therefore, I am storing the extracted copies of the signatures with the original signing dates to this repository. 

1) oslc-op-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for OSLC Open Project. 8 signatures

2) originbx-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for OriginBX Open Project. 2 signatures

3) oca-op-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for Open Cybersecurity Alliance Open Project. 76 signatures

4) eea-oasis-icla-07-13-2021.csv - CLA signatures for EEA Community Projects Managed Open Project. 3 signatures

In addition, on July 15, 2021, I found that the Drupal records imported when we configured the CLA Bot for the Open Repository program (February 25, 2021) were incomplete. They only list the Github ID, the copy of the i-cla effective and the date of loading. I pulled drupal-icla-export-07-15-1951.csv and loaded it here to maintain a copy of the historical signatures. If we need to trace a signature backwards, we have the Github ID in both sets of files so that we can cross-reference to the original signature. 

5) drupal-icla-export-07-15-1951.csv - CLA signatures from the original Drupal i-cla application. 131 signatures.
